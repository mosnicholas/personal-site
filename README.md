# Personal Site

My personal site (live on [https://nimo.fyi](https://nimo.fyi)) is built with some of my favorite web development tools:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment
- [Google Domains](https://domains.google) for domain management
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) React component library
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) to scaffold the react app
- [kbar](https://kbar.vercel.app) created by my friend Tim to manage cmd + k
- [eslint](https://eslint.org) & [prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [React Scroll Parallax](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/intro) for fun scrolling

Enjoy, and please shoot me any feedback you have.
