- Minimalist design philosophy
- Built with React, TypeScript, and Chakra UI

## Development Preferences
- Uses Yarn for package management
- TypeScript for type safety
- React 17 (planning to upgrade)
- Chakra UI for component library
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality

- Removed calendar booking functionality to prevent random people from booking calls
